Effective Date: 2025-01-04

## Introduction
Agin Music is an open-source client application for OpenSubsonic media servers. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and provides transparency about data collection and usage practices.

## No Data Collection
As the developer of Agin Music, I do not collect, store, or process any user data. Your usage of the app remains entirely private, and no information is transmitted to me or any external services by Agin Music.

## Data Collected by Media Servers
Agin Music acts as a client that connects to an OpenSubsonic-compatible media server of your choice. The data you provide, such as server credentials or media preferences, is used exclusively to interact with the server.

## Please note that the media server you connect to may collect, store, or process your data in accordance with its own privacy policy. It is your responsibility to review the privacy policy of the media server you use to understand how your data is handled.

## Open Source Transparency
Agin Music is open source, and its source code is publicly available. This transparency ensures that anyone can review the code to confirm that no data is being collected or shared.

## Third-Party Services
Agin Music does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics tools that could collect or process your data.

## Security
While Agin Music does not collect data, it is recommended that you use secure connections (e.g., HTTPS) when connecting to media servers to protect your credentials and data during transmission.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated policy with the effective date noted.
